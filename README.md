- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dvorchuck
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Programming, Data Science
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science stack (Python + libs, Tableau, SQL) 



**My journey:**

2018
My first "hello world" was written on 23rd December 2018 while watching python tutorial by freeCodeCamp.
I've tried to make a simple bot to automate a browser game.
- Python basics

2019
Doing Udemy course on Javacript (learned: basics of JS and DOM, intro to async).
Utilizing JS kwowledge in Google Apps Script and slowly becoming Google Sheets master.
- JavaScript, DOM, Google Apps Script, G Suite

2020
Started my first IT related part-time job in a startup company. 
Working with APIs of CRMs (Close.com, Pipedrive, HubSpot) and PM tools (ClickUp).
- RESTful API
- Async JS

2021
Building internal database with oversight of senior developer.
I was finally introduced to real world stack for development:
- TypeScript
- MongoDB
- Jest
- Git
A bit owerwhelming to learn all at the same time, that resulted to vague use of types and tests in the start.

Later this year I took a Java course at school. I fell in love with the statically typed nature and its tooling. 
- Java

2022
Learning Data Science at work and creating first vizualizations for the clients. I've also started using Keboola for ETL.
- SQL
- Tableau

I've revisited python again and decided to use it for scrapping. (in progress)
- Scrapy, scrapyd
- Selenium, BeautifulSoup4
- MongoDB


Future:
- Learning Go.
- Build Node.js Backend based project
- switching to Linux (unfortunately Tableau is not supported > dual boot)
